            <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia" style="color: aquamarine">Geralt of Rivia</a> was
            a legendary witcher of the <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/School_of_the_Wolf"
                style="color: aquamarine;">School of the Wolf</a> active throughout the
            13th century. He
            loved the sorceress <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Yennefer_of_Vengerberg"
                style="color: aquamarine">Yennefer</a>, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous
            relationship, and
            became Ciri's adoptive father.<br><br>During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance
            for
            the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental
            mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his
            fellow witchers.<br><br>Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with
            the
            witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the
            interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up
            surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du
            Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all
            that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as
            to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in
            the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him.
            He, therefore, became a true knight.

        <h2><b>Weapons</b></h2>
        <p style="width: 70%;">
            Geralt's weapon arsenal includes swords, axes, crossbows, bombs and magical spells.<br>
        </p>
        <h3><b>Swords</b></h3>
        <p>Witchers use two types of blades: steel swords and silver swords. Steel swords are most effective against
            non-magical beasts, humans and non-humans. Silver swords are most effective against monsters and magical
            creatures. The color of the vitality bar of an enemy indicates what sword type is more effective against
            them. If the bar is red, use a steel sword. If the bar is silver, use a silver sword.<br><br>
            Geralt draws automatically the most suitable sword when he enters combat. However, you can manually switch
            to the other sword or even go unarmed. Silver swords can be suitable against non-magical beasts: they deal
            significantly reduced damage -less than a steel sword of the same level- but have no other obvious
            drawbacks. On the other hand, steel swords, secondary weapons and unarmed punches are completely unsuitable
            against Magical creatures. Their significantly higher health makes using lower-damage steel swords
            inefficient, and magical creatures often stun Geralt for a couple of seconds if he hits them with anything
            other than a silver sword, including barehanded punches.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Crossbows</b></h3>
        <img style="width: 100%"
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373951/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1659617651"
            alt="Crossbows">
        <p> Crossbows are one-handed weapons best used for knocking down flying foes and when attacking from a distance.
            Crossbows are the only weapons that can be used while swimming, diving or piloting a boat. They can be used
            on horseback. You can choose which bolts to use with your crossbow in the inventory panel. Some bolts have
            special attributes. On land crossbows don't inflict as much damage as swords or signs, and serve more as a
            tool than a weapon.<br><br>
            Crossbows deal far more damage underwater than on land, which means they often kill enemies with just one
            shot. This also switches over for monsters that are normally land creatures. For instance, if a Wyvern
            somehow got stuck underwater, one is able to kill the enemy in just a handful of shots.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Bombs</b></h3>
        <img style="width: 100%" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.8uOxM6xNbVTHFnc-DJO_0AAAAA?pid=ImgDet&rs=1"
            alt="Bombs">
        <p> Bombs are explosives that can be thrown at enemies from a distance. They can be acquired as loot or crafted.
            Some have crowd control effects, including stuns, slows, blinds and burnings. These are best used as
            engagement tools for strike-combinations.<br><br>

        <h2><b>The Witcher Signs</b></h2>
        <p style="width: 70%; text-align: justify;">
            Though they are not warrior mages who employ powerful magic, witchers can cast simple magic spells
            that can prove effective when used properly. Witchers call these spells signs and usually use them
            against monsters, though they also have non-combat applications. Because of the signs, witchers
            prefer single-handed weaponry since it leaves their other hand free to cast. Some of the signs are
            cast by arranging the fingers in specific way, while the others have to be drawn on a solid surface.

        <h2><b>Adrenaline</b></h2>
        <p>Adrenaline is one of the point values used in combat, located just under the stamina bar. As you deal damage
            to your opponents, your adrenaline meter will go up slowly, throughout three sections of the bar for three
            adrenaline points. The higher your adrenaline, the more damage you will do (up to a maximum of +30%) and the
            less damage you will take. It can be increased before a fight with an alghoul decoction or the Maribor
            Forest potion. It can also be increasing with an ability from mutations.<br><br>You will lose adrenaline if
            you get hit in combat, leave combat, or use the following abilities that use adrenaline:<br></p>
