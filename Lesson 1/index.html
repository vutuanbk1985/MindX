    <h2><b>Nature</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"">Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer
        to the phenomena of the
        physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
        Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural
        phenomena.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify">The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin
        word natura, or "essential
        qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura
        is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the
        intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own
        accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the
        original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers
        (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency
        ever since.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature
        became the passive reality,
        organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the
        part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions
        (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).
        However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially
        after Charles Darwin.</p>
    <h2><b>Earth</b></h2>
    <p>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science">Earth Science</a></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Earth is the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet">planet</a>known to
        support life, and its natural
        features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar System, it is third closest to
        the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic
        features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical
        to subtropical region. Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to
        less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder
        consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
